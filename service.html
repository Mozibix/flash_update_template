<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> 3. Vendors: Selling your products
<br/> 
<br/> Content: As a vendor hereunder, you may submit one or more products for sale (“products”) via the Flashupdate9ja marketplace. The products may include any form of digital content (written, audio, video, etc.) (“Content”) as is appropriate for your products. All digital products and content must be suitable for digital delivery.
<br/> 
<br/> Flashupdate9ja acts as a reseller for the vendors' products. That means that buyers are technically buying from flashupdate9ja and not directly from the vendor. You will however retain all rights and liabilities to your products except as provided herein.
<br/> 
<br/> You understand that Flashupdate9ja will review your products or content for completeness, accuracy, quality, marketability, or the like, so it's your responsibility as a vendor to submit products with complete, accurate and quality contents that match truthfully what's advertised in your sales page, or else Flashupdate9ja might remove them from the marketplace.
<br/> Flashupdate9ja reserves the right to reject any product(s) for any reason or no reason at any time in its sole discretion. Moreover, it is to your great advantage to ensure the quality of your product(s). Each product will be subject to reviews and/or ratings from purchasers, which will be available and/or prominently displayed to potential buyers of your product(s) in the market place.
<br/> 
<br/> (i) Allowed product(s):
<br/> 
<br/> Flashupdate9ja does not allow, and you agree not to, submit any product(s) or content that are pornographic or offensive in nature, or which pertain to pyramid schemes, multi-level marketing (mlm) or any illegal activity, or which contains any illegal material including but not limited to material that violates another’s copyrights or trademarks, trade dress, trade secrets, right of publicity, privacy or other rights, including moral rights or rights of attribution. Flashupdate9ja shall use its unfettered discretion and expressly reserves the right to remove any such products, content or material from the marketplace, without notice and without compensation to you. You agree that any advertising or other fees paid in connection with products, content, or other material that is removed from the marketplace will not be refunded. You further agree that you remain fully responsible for any damages to Flashupdate9ja and to its customers that result from your submission to, or inclusion of such products, content, or material in the marketplace.
<br/> 
<br/> To be included in the Flashupdate9ja marketplace, your products must be original. Private label rights (“plr”) that you have obtained cannot be the basis of a product. Plr material can be offered, for example, as a free bonus distributed alongside a product, but not as the product itself. Flashupdate9ja reserves the right to refuse to accept any product or to remove any product that it deems to lack sufficient originality. You must have all required rights, including copyrights to all content in your product(s) to allow Flashupdate9ja to sell the product. The foregoing requirement includes all content within the product(s), for example cover images, as well as any music, including background music in recorded audio or video products. In addition to the other licenses granted herein, you also grant Flashupdate9ja a limited license to resell your products, and process all payments in connection therewith. Flashupdate9ja shall pay you in accordance with the payment provisions herein. Where you fail to ensure compliance with any of the above the failure of Flashupdate9ja to request at the time of submission shall not limit your liability in anyway.
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> (ii) Pricing of Product(s):
<br/> 
<br/> Vendors and only vendors may set the price (“sales price”) of their own products within the limits established by Flashupdate9ja for minimum and/or maximum prices (“price limits”). As a vendor, you agree not to attempt to price any product submitted to the marketplace outside of then current price limits in place at the time of submitting the product to the Flashupdate9ja marketplace. Flashupdate9ja will post its current price limits prominently on the site. Currently, the "lower price limit" is N5000 and the “upper price limit” is N800,000 for any product offered for sale in the marketplace. However, Flashupdate9ja expressly reserves the right to set the "upper price limit” for the marketplace as a whole, or on a per vendor basis. Vendors with marketplace track records of greater merit (including, e.g., lower refund rates, better purchaser reviews, higher ratings, longevity, etc.) may be afforded greater latitude in pricing their products, at Flashupdate9ja discretion. You understand that as a vendor, you are subject to the foregoing price limits unless you have been expressly notified in writing from flashupdate9ja. Flashupdate9ja will review each petition for a price limit raise on a case by case basis, and may accept or decline the petition in its sole discretion.
<br/> 
<br/> Notwithstanding the foregoing price limits, Flashupdate9ja also reserves the right to raise the upper price limit on a per product basis (i.e. for a particular product from a specific vendor) based on Flashupdate9ja direct review (“price review”) which may include consideration of the vendor’s history in the marketplace, reputation in the industry, the product itself, the proposed price, market conditions, current terms and relationships with payment processors, gateways, and such other factors as Flashupdate9ja chooses. After such a price review, Flashupdate9ja decision as to whether to raise the upper price limit in any instance shall be final and made in its sole discretion. If Flashupdate9ja chooses not to raise the price limit for a given product, vendor agrees that the product shall be offered in the marketplace at a sales price below the upper price limit. Flashupdate9ja may charge a “review request fee” or may allow each vendor to request a set number of such price reviews at no cost, and may charge a review request fee for any additional price reviews requested by that vendor.
<br/> 
<br/> As a vendor, you understand and agree not to offer the same product listed on the Flashupdate9ja marketplace for a different price somewhere else. This includes your website. In situations where the vendor has to alter the price of a particular product listed on the Flashupdate9ja marketplace on the vendor's website, the vendor must inform Flashupdate9ja to update the price on the Flashupdate9ja website as well.
<br/> 
<br/> Flashupdate9ja reserves the right to suspend a Vendor's product if there are differences in price listed on the Vendor's website versus what is listed on Flashupdate9ja
<br/> 
<br/> Flashupdate9ja may terminate any vendor who violates this provision repeatedly and the vendor shall be solely responsible for any liability that may result from such.
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> The products must be original and the vendor must hold all required copyrights of the product(s) and content to allow Flashupdate9ja to sell the product(s). The product(s) must not relate to any of our forbidden niches (pornography, gambling, pyramid schemes, etc).
<br/> 
<br/> Vendors warrant and represent that;
<br/> 
<br/> They have the right and full authority to enter into this Agreement with Flashupdate9ja.
<br/> 
<br/> All their obligations under this Agreement are legal, valid and binding obligations enforceable in law.

<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> 4. Affiliates: Promoting products for a commission
<br/> 
<br/> As an affiliate in the Flashupdate9ja marketplace, you will have the opportunity to promote and make commissions on a wide variety of digital products offered via the state of the art Flashupdate9ja marketplace. As described above, products offered through the Flashupdate9ja marketplace are provided by our vendors for sale by Flashupdate9ja.
<br/> 
<br/> You evaluate and choose which product(s) to promote:
<br/> 
<br/> As an affiliate, you are solely responsible for evaluating and selecting the vendors and product(s) you would like to market or advertise. Flashupdate9ja endeavors to maintain the highest quality in the marketplace through its unique review system. Unlike other marketplaces where products are not reviewed and left to guess work.
<br/> 
<br/> However, you should understand and agree that Flashupdate9ja is not responsible for the contents, accuracy, quality, usefulness, or any other aspects of any product, or any supplementary products.
<br/> 
<br/> You understand and agree that you are solely responsible for any costs associated with marketing, advertising, or mailing, including any marketing materials you choose to develop, regardless of whether your marketing or advertising efforts results in sales or not. Moreover, Flashupdate9ja does not provide any legal advice or review of your advertisements and you are solely responsible for the content of your marketing and advertising efforts and any liability resulting therefrom.
<br/> 
<br/> Use only respectful promotion practices:
<br/> 
<br/> You agree that you will not use any marketing or advertising materials which contain any illegal material including but not limited to material that violates another’s copyrights or trademarks, trade dress, trade secrets, right of publicity, privacy or other rights, including moral rights or rights of attribution, or which are defamatory.
<br/> 
<br/> Moreover, you agree that your advertisements and/or promotions will accurately represent the product(s), without hyping or exaggerating the contents, benefits or features. You must represent the product(s) in a truthful manner.
<br/> 
<br/> You further agree that, in connection with products in the Flashupdate9ja marketplace, you will not use any marketing or advertising methods that include illegal methods including unsolicited email or sms, false or misleading advertisements or any advertisement which makes any claim that is not permitted about earnings or other aspects of a product, or other violates any law or regulation.
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> You understand and agree that your marketing and advertising efforts shall not state or suggest that you are in fact Flashupdate9ja, or representing Flashupdate9ja or endorsed by Flashupdate9ja in any way or that you are the owner of the product as this will be treated as impersonation. Your marketing and advertising will not contain or utilize the Flashupdate9ja content (as defined herein) except as expressly permitted.
<br/> 
<br/> You understand and agree that you will not personalize the vendor of the product you are promoting in any way through your marketing and advertising or suggest that you are the vendor. If you are found to mislead people by using the name(s) of the vendor as your own, it may result in Flashupdate9ja terminating your affiliate account and seizing any commissions you have in your affiliate balance without any warning whatsoever.
<br/> 
<br/> Flashupdate9ja does not allow and you agree not to promote, market, or advertise any products or utilizing advertisements that are pornographic in nature, pyramid schemes, multi-level marketing (mlm)). You may not combine your advertising for products on the Flashupdate9ja marketplace with advertising for any such non-permitted products (including products not on the Flashupdate9ja marketplace).
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> You agree not to state, or imply any guarantee or warranty about the product or a refund period other than what is expressly provided through the Flashupdate9ja marketplace. Marketing or advertising that provides, states, or implies any additional guarantee or warranty is expressly prohibited. Flashupdate9ja may terminate any affiliate who violates this provision and the affiliate shall be solely responsible for any liability that may result from such representation.
<br/> 
<br/> You understand that Flashupdate9ja will use commercially reasonable efforts to track purchases so as to accurately account for affiliate commissions. Tracking codes, cookies, and/or similar technological means will be used where appropriate. When a potential purchaser views and/or responds to your advertisement, which includes your Flashupdate9ja affiliate information, any resulting sale will be credited to your account. Flashupdate9ja does not permit and you agree not to use any click jacking, cookie stuffing or other technological means of altering a Flashupdate9ja visitor’s cookies in any way to obtain commissions or credit for sales for which you would otherwise not be entitled. Flashupdate9ja reserves the right to determine who receives an affiliate commission for any particular sale. Flashupdate9ja also reserves the right to terminate, without notice, any affiliate who in Flashupdate9ja’ sole determination, has unacceptably manipulated the tracking of purchases or commissions.
<br/> 
<br/> So, basically vendors (and Flashupdate9ja) can block affiliates with a large history of refunded transaction, low quality traffic, etc. moreover, you may have to apply in advance as an affiliate for some of the products you want to promote on Flashupdate9ja.
<br/> 
<br/> It's your responsibility to select the right products to promote from our marketplace. Flashupdate9ja will do its best to ensure that the products on our platform are top notch but we do not offer any guarantee or representation in that regard.
<br/> 
<br/> Use only respectful promotion practices (no spamming, no cookie stuffing, etc.), and don't exaggerate or hype the product beyond its truthful characteristics.
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> 5. Amount of commission to be paid on product sales
<br/> 
<br/> In exchange for their efforts in marketing and advertising products available in the Flashupdate9ja marketplace, affiliates will earn a commission determined as a percentage of the sales price of any product (“affiliate commission”) for sales resulting from those marketing and advertising efforts.
<br/> 
<br/> A vendor can set the affiliate commission for any product(s) from 25% to 95%. Proceeds of the sales for each product shall be paid as follows: Flashupdate9ja fees shall be deducted from the gross sales price, and the affiliate commission shall also be based on the gross sales price as well. Any remaining balance after the Flashupdate9ja fees and affiliate commission are paid will be paid to the product vendor.
<br/> 
<br/> Flashupdate9ja uses a secure tracking system to determine which affiliate referred the sale, and is entitled to a commission.
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> So, basically affiliates are paid a commission for their promotion efforts. The vendor of the product determines the commission structure for that product.
<br/> 
<br/> The proceeds that remain after paying the affiliate commissions and Flashupdate9ja fees are paid to the vendor.
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> Flashupdate9ja uses a smart tracking system to track affiliate commissions.
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> 6. Secure vendor/affiliate access and communication
<br/> 
<br/> Upon registration as a vendor or affiliate, you will receive an Flashupdate9ja id and password to login as an Flashupdate9ja vendor/affiliate, from which you can access the vendor/affiliate resources (e.g. the ability to enter a new product, get affiliate links,  check sales and other history). Except as otherwise agreed or permitted by Flashupdate9ja in writing, you may not share or transfer your id and secure password or access to the Flashupdate9ja system in any way or with any one. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Flashupdate9ja id and password and for any activity in connection with your account.
<br/> 
<br/> It is also your responsibility to keep your phone number and primary email address up to date so that Flashupdate9ja can communicate with you via emails, phone calls and sms. You understand and agree that if Flashupdate9ja sends you an electronic communication but you do not receive it because your primary email address on file is incorrect, out of date, full, or your email is directed to a trash or spam filter, or you are otherwise unable to receive email or messages, the electronic communication will be deemed to have been provided to you.
<br/> 
<br/> You can update your primary email address or other contact information at any time by logging into your Flashupdate9ja vendor dashboard. If your email address becomes invalid such that emails sent to you from flashupdate9ja are returned, we may deem your account to be inactive and your status as a vendor/affiliate may be suspended or placed on hold until we receive a valid, working primary email address from you.
<br/> 
<br/> So, basically your login access is individual and private, and it's your responsibility to keep it that way. You may receive email or sms notifications from Flashupdate9ja.
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> 7. Sales pages and promotional material.
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> Contents of sales pages:
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> The vendor is responsible for the content of the product sales page (“sales page”). You, the vendor, agree to provide all content to Flashupdate9ja in the permitted or required format(s) as determined by Flashupdate9ja and/or to upload such content in the permitted or required format(s) in your vendor dashboard. As a vendor, you have no direct access or rights to alter any sales page.
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> Hosting:
<br/> 
<br/> You understand and agree that the sales page ("sales page”) promoting the content and/or products on the marketplace will be hosted by flashupdate9ja on Flashupdate9ja servers.
<br/> 
<br/> Flashupdate9ja will make the sales pages in the marketplace available on the internet, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the availability (i.e. uptime) of such sales pages for the consuming public. However, no guarantees of uptime are made. Flashupdate9ja does not own or control the internet and shall have no responsibility or liability for any time(s) the marketplace or specific sale pages are not accessible (i.e. “downtime”), even if your marketing and/or advertising efforts, product sales, or commissions are disrupted as a result of such downtime, and even if the downtime is a result of Flashupdate9ja error or negligence.
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> Claims on sales pages or promotions:
<br/> 
<br/> Whether you are acting as a vendor or affiliate for a product, Flashupdate9ja strictly prohibits any false or misleading claims in product(s), sales pages, or in advertisements including your sales copy or other marketing or advertising materials related to product(s) on the Flashupdate9ja marketplace, including any affiliate advertising materials.
<br/> 
<br/> You may not and you agree not to:
<br/> 
<br/> Make any unsupported, misleading, or false claim about any content or product, or results that it can produce.
<br/> 
<br/> Include any false or misleading testimonial, endorsement, or implied endorsement. As a vendor, fail to disclose material connections between your endorsers of your product; or as an affiliate, fail to disclose material connections between any endorser of a product you are promoting and the product provider. You must also disclose if any reviewer or endorser of your product was compensated.
<br/> 
<br/> Fail to include any disclaimer or statement(s) needed to qualify your claims, or to keep your advertising from being false or misleading. Make any suggestions or unsupported claims as to amounts of income or earnings that are typical or, that a purchaser will likely make, or should expect.
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> 8. Signup fees, pay-outs and refunds, and product refund policy:
<br/> 
<br/> As a vendor, you agree that once placed in the Flashupdate9ja marketplace, sales of your product will be subject to a 30-day money-back guarantee from Flashupdate9ja.
<br/> 
<br/> Consistent with Flashupdate9ja guarantee, purchasers are entitled to a 30-day refund period or depending on the product vendor's desired configuration for that particular product.
<br/> 
<br/> Buyers, affiliates and vendors with a high refund history may be banned from purchasing, selling or promoting products again from the marketplace.
<br/> 
<br/> Flashupdate9ja may occasionally and at its sole discretion decide to grant a refund beyond the product money-back guarantee period.
<br/> 
<br/> Payment processing and signup fees:
<br/> 
<br/> To facilitate the marketplace, Flashupdate9ja will connect with other third party companies (including banks) to process all payments for all product purchases made through the Flashupdate9ja marketplace. Thus, you expressly grant permission to Flashupdate9ja to sell your products, and to process payments received from the sale of your product(s) in the marketplace, and agree to pay the assigned transaction or processing fees (“Flashupdate9ja fees”) in exchange for the services provided by Flashupdate9ja, currently, the Flashupdate9ja fees are as follows:
<br/> 
<br/> For affiliates:
<br/> 
<br/> All affiliates are required to register on Flashupdate9ja with N10,000. This sum of N10,000 is a yearly, non-refundable fee for affiliate maintenance paid to Flashupdate9ja. Flashupdate9ja has the rights to debit each affiliate of this sum once in a year.
<br/> 
<br/> For vendors:
<br/> 
<br/> All vendors are required to register on Flashupdate9ja with N25,000 to start selling their products. This is a yearly, non-refundable fee. Flashupdate9ja has the rights to debit each vendor of this sum once in a year, plus Flashupdate9ja will also charge a commission of 10% per sale on all vendor products, these Flashupdate9ja fees can be changed at any time, and vendors and affiliates will be notified.
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> Payments to vendors/affiliates:
<br/> 
<br/> Except as provided below for first affiliate sale reserve, high-volume sales, or fraud investigation reserve, affiliates will be paid their commissions once in a week and vendors will be paid twice a month.
<br/> 
<br/> Currently, affiliates and vendors can receive payments via any Nigerian bank account, and Flashupdate9ja is constantly working to offer new payment methods. Affiliates must have a minimum of N5000 in their Flashupdate9ja balance to qualify for a weekly payment.
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> Affiliate first-sale exception:
<br/> 
<br/> Affiliates will not receive commission from their very first sale for each product they promote. this is to prevent the incentive for affiliate ‘fraud’ where an affiliate plays the system by granting themselves an instant discount (in the form of their affiliate commission) by purchasing a product through their own affiliate link. Flashupdate9ja wants professional affiliates who provide a legitimate service to the vendors, and their own customers, in addition to Flashupdate9ja. From the second sale onwards, affiliate commissions will be registered as usual. If you believe that, as an affiliate, you will only generate one sale per product promoted, you must not sign up as an affiliate.
<br/> 
<br/> However, in the event of any unusual activity, a transaction volume spike or any specific transaction triggering our security filters, Flashupdate9ja reserves the right to hold credits beyond the standard 10-day period subject to Flashupdate9ja manual investigation of the account's recent activity. This generally will only take a few days, however Flashupdate9ja reserves the right to reasonably extend the reserve period for a time sufficient to resolve its questions about unusual activity to its own satisfaction.
<br/> 
<br/> Flashupdate9ja endeavours to keep its reserves/holdback of processed payments as low as possible, and to generally release funds to vendors/affiliates within 10 days from the sale.
<br/> 
<br/> However, in the event of any unusual activity, a transaction volume spike or any specific transaction triggering our security filters, Flashupdate9ja reserves the right to hold the credits beyond the standard 10-day period until a system administrator manually investigates the account's recent activity. This usually shouldn't take more than a few days.
<br/> 
<br/> Fraud investigation reserve period:
<br/> 
<br/> If Flashupdate9ja or one of Flashupdate9ja payment processors becomes aware of actual fraud, or suspected fraud in connection with any purchase or group of purchases related to your account, Flashupdate9ja reserves the right to require a fraud investigation. If such an investigation is required, any and all earnings/commissions earned on any basis may be temporarily held pending the investigation, whether or not connected to the actual or suspected fraud. Flashupdate9ja will use commercially reasonable efforts to have the fewest potential earnings/commissions held, based on its review of its risk. Such fraud may be in connection with debit cards, traffic, tracking, or some other basis.
<br/> 
<br/> If a fraud investigation is initiated, the vendor/affiliate may be asked to provide additional information. You agree to cooperate with any such fraud investigation in a reasonable manner. You will be informed of the results of the investigation, and a full accounting will be provided regarding your account and any earnings/commissions due.
<br/> 
<br/> Any vendor/affiliate that has actual or suspected fraudulent activity associated with one or more otherwise creditable or commission-earning sales should not assume that Flashupdate9ja suspects them of fraud. Stolen debit cards, fake debit cards, and other scams are prevalent on the internet and such activity may have nothing to do with the vendor/affiliate. Nonetheless, you understand and agree that you cannot be paid for an otherwise creditable or commission-earning sale, where Flashupdate9ja will not be paid. Moreover, Flashupdate9ja will comply with all legal requirements and will report all such activities to appropriate authorities. If a vendor/affiliate is believed to be directly or indirectly involved with fraudulent activity or attempted fraudulent activity in connection with the Flashupdate9ja marketplace, Flashupdate9ja will pursue all available legal action against the vendor/affiliate. In such circumstances, you agree that you will forfeit any balance in your account, and that flashupdate9ja may use any such funds to partially or fully defray its costs of its investigation and any subsequent action, including legal fees and costs.
<br/> 
<br/> Affiliates signup and maintenance fee: N10,000/year
<br/> 
<br/> Vendors signup and maintenance fee: N25,000/year
<br/> 
<br/> Plus Flashupdate9ja will charge a commission of 10% per sale on all vendor products.
<br/> 
<br/> 
<br/> Funds generated from vendor/affiliate will be released about 3 days after the refund period has expired. So, once those funds are indeed released, you will be paid.
<br/> 
<br/> If there's any unusual activity detected on your account, or if our security filters are triggered, the reserve period may be increased while an administrator reviews the account's recent activity.
<br/> 
<br/> 9. Relationship with Flashupdate9ja:
<br/> 
<br/> You understand and agree that by becoming a vendor/affiliate, no legal partnership, joint venture, or agency relationship is created between you and Flashupdate9ja. Neither you nor Flashupdate9ja is a partner, a joint venturer, an agent or has any authority to obligate or bind the other. You may not represent otherwise. As a vendor, you understand that you are allowing Flashupdate9ja to sell the product(s)/content you place in the marketplace.
